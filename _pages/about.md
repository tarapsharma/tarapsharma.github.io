Hello! I’m Tara Prasad Sharma, a passionate mathematician and a Ph.D. student in Mathematics at Texas A&M University (TAMU). With a deep love for numbers, structures, and their applications, my journey in mathematics has been driven by curiosity and the desire to contribute to the world of academia and beyond.

Academic Journey
I hold an M.Sc. in Mathematics from Sikkim University, where I focused on areas such as Analysis, Algebra, and Algebraic Topology under the guidance of Dr. Goutam Bhunia and Dr. Yadav. My research during this period included a significant project on the Stone–Čech Compactification Theorem, which fueled my passion for mathematical abstractions and their practical interpretations.

Research Interests
My current interests lie at the intersection of Applied Mathematics, Mathematical Biology, and Biostatistics. I am particularly fascinated by the application of mathematical models to address real-world problems in healthcare, epidemiology, and biological research. My goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical mathematics and its impactful applications in science and society.

Teaching and Mentorship
With over a decade of teaching experience, including two years in secondary school education, I take pride in sharing the beauty of mathematics with learners of all levels. My approach emphasizes conceptual understanding and fostering a genuine appreciation for the subject. I am constantly seeking ways to improve as an educator and mentor.

Skills and Expertise
Programming: Python (basic), MATLAB, HTML, C, LaTeX, Git
Mathematical Modeling: Real Analysis, Algebraic Topology, Statistics
Data Analysis: Statistical tools and practical applications in research
Beyond Mathematics
Apart from academics, I am an avid volunteer, having contributed extensively to organizations such as the Sikkim Vipassana Centre. My interests also include exploring nature, meditating, and giving back to the community.

Future Aspirations
As I progress in my academic and professional journey, I aim to contribute meaningfully to research and education. My vision is to leverage the power of mathematics to solve complex problems while inspiring others to see its limitless possibilities.

Feel free to connect with me to discuss research ideas, teaching methodologies, or collaboration opportunities!
