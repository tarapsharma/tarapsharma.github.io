Hi! I’m **Tara Prasad Sharma**, a Ph.D. student in Mathematics at **Texas A&M University**. I'm deeply passionate about exploring mathematics not just as a subject, but as a way of understanding the world.

What excites me most about math is how abstract ideas can lead to powerful real-world insights. I’m especially curious about how mathematical thinking intersects with biology, health, and data-driven research.

### My Journey

I come from the serene hills of Sikkim, India, where education and self-awareness have always walked hand in hand. Over the years, my love for mathematics and my commitment to inner growth have evolved together—shaping both my personal and academic journey.

My time at TAMU is an extension of this path: diving deep into research, learning with curiosity, and contributing meaningfully to the community around me.

### Grounded in Dhamma

I’m a long-time practitioner and volunteer of **Vipassana meditation**, a path of self-transformation through observation and equanimity. Practicing **Dhamma** has helped me cultivate clarity, discipline, and compassion—qualities that directly enrich my research, teaching, and daily life.

Serving at **Vipassana centers** has also strengthened my sense of purpose, reminding me that true education is not only about intellect but also about wisdom and character.

### My Values

- **Curiosity** — I always ask *why* and *how*.  
- **Simplicity** — I believe in explaining complex ideas in a way anyone can understand.  
- **Service** — Whether through teaching, volunteering, or research, I aim to make a positive impact.  
- **Mindfulness** — Staying balanced and aware, both inside and outside the classroom.

### Beyond Academia

Outside my studies, I enjoy quiet walks in nature, practicing meditation, and engaging in volunteer service. These moments of stillness and giving are what keep me focused and fulfilled.
