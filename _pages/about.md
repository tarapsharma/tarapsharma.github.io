Hi! I’m **Tara Prasad Sharma**, a Ph.D. student in Mathematics at **Texas A&M University**. I view mathematics not just as a formal science, but as a lens for understanding the deep patterns of our world.

### Research & Curiosity
What excites me most is how abstract mathematical structures intersect with **biology, health, and data-driven research**. My journey at TAMU is defined by this curiosity—diving deep into research while contributing meaningfully to the academic community.

### Grounded in Dhamma
I am a long-time practitioner and volunteer of **Vipassana meditation**. This path of self-transformation through equanimity is the foundation of my daily life. Practicing **Dhamma** cultivates the clarity and discipline I bring to my equations, and the compassion I bring to my teaching.

> "True education is not only about intellect, but also about wisdom and character."

### Core Values
* **Simplicity:** Translating complex mathematical abstractions into intuitive insights.
* **Service:** Making an impact through teaching and volunteering at Vipassana centers.
* **Mindfulness:** Maintaining balance and awareness inside and outside the classroom.

### Beyond the Chalkboard
Originally from the serene hills of **Sikkim, India**, I find my balance in nature and stillness. Whether I am exploring a theorem or sitting in meditation, I strive to stay present and purposeful.

### Let’s Connect
I welcome connections with fellow researchers, students, or anyone interested in the intersection of math and mindfulness.
