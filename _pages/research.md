My research lies at the intersection of **Numerical Analysis**, **Scientific Computing**, and **Data-Driven Modeling**. As a Ph.D. student at **Texas A&M University**, I am interested in developing algorithms that are not only mathematically rigorous but also computationally efficient for real-world applications.

### Current Research Focus

#### 1. Numerical Analysis & Differential Equations
I explore the stability and convergence of numerical methods. My goal is to create solvers that can handle complex physical systems with high precision and lower computational cost.

#### 2. Machine Learning & Data Science
I am fascinated by how **ML and AI** can enhance traditional mathematical models. I work on bridging the gap between "black-box" neural networks and the "white-box" transparency of physical laws (Physics-Informed Neural Networks).

#### 3. Interdisciplinary Applications
Mathematics is a universal language. I am particularly interested in applying these techniques to:
* **Healthcare & Bio-Math:** Modeling disease spread or biological patterns.
* **Climate Modeling:** Using data-driven research to understand environmental changes.

### Academic Philosophy
In my research, I follow the **Middle Path**: 
> "Avoid the extremes of pure abstraction without utility, and pure data-crunching without theoretical foundation. Truth lies in the balance of both."

### Selected Projects & Posters
* *Numerical Simulations of Non-linear Systems* (TAMU Math Dept, 2025)
* *Data-Driven Insights into Local Health Trends* (Sikkim Research Initiative, 2024)

### Collaborative Spirit
I am always open to interdisciplinary collaboration. If you are working on a project that requires a mathematical lens or a numerical solver, please reach out.
