Hi! I’m **Tara Prasad Sharma**, a Ph.D. student in Mathematics at **Texas A&M University**. I view mathematics not just as a formal science, but as a lens for understanding the deep patterns of our world.

### Research & Curiosity
What excites me most is how abstract mathematical structures intersect with **Machine Learning, AI, Data Science, and Health**. My goal is to bridge the gap between rigorous theory and data-driven insights.

* **Current Focus:** Numerical Analysis and Applied Math.
* **Office:** 605, Blocker Building, TAMU.

### Grounded in Dhamma
I am a long-time practitioner and volunteer of [Vipassana meditation](https://www.dhamma.org). This path of self-transformation through equanimity is the foundation of my daily life. Practicing [Dhamma](https://www.vridhamma.org) cultivates the clarity and discipline I bring to my equations, and the compassion I bring to my teaching.

### Beyond the Chalkboard
Originally from the serene hills of **Sikkim, India**, I find my balance in nature and stillness. I strive to stay present and purposeful—whether I am exploring a complex theorem or sitting in quiet meditation.
